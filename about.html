              <br>
              <p><i>Client Side Solutions</i> is a personal project that aims to provide simple yet powerful tools regarding the analytical space.</p>
        <p>You will find on this website tools & services that can be used right away. Play with it and explore the capabilites of "C.S.S".</p>
        <p>A documentation is available <a href="">here</a> for more informations about the various displayed apps</p>
        <p>Keep it mind that these showcased applications were meant to tackle predetermined tasks for demonstration purpose.</p>
          <p>Therefore, they can  be tuned to better fit similar needs you might have.</p>

			  <div id="Why" style="display:none">
              <h4><strong>Why <i>Client Side Solutions</i> ?</strong></h4>
              <br>
              <p>Client Side Solutions : Working on the client side.</p>
        <p>It's easier for companies to sell server based software: You take your customer's data and you keep the code.</p>
		<p>Meaning that while you provide a service, the end product does not entirely belong to your customer. If interested, he is forced to create an account / subscribe to your services</p>
        <p>On the other end, some people needing these tools might be left out:</p>

		<p>Server based solutions might not be allowed by their IT environment : forbidden to transfersensitive data, not enough IT maturity, lack of programming skills.
		</p>
          <p>Last but not least: While the server based approach enables complex analytic operations, it is often overkill regarding the targeted task. Wasting energy and unecessary ressources:</p>

        <div id="How" style="display:none">
              <h4><strong>How  does Client Side Solutions work ?</strong></h4>
              <br>
              <p>Client Side Solutions : Working on <b>client side</b>.</p>
        <p>Put it simply : when you are visiting a website, your computer is doing some work to render what you are seeing.</p>
        <p>Client Side Solutions just ask him on top of that, a little extra-work to perform the required task.</p>
        <p>For simple tasks as showcased here : no need to spend more energy powering up distant servers to achieve what is needed.</p>
          <p>No need to send (sensitive) data far away: everything stay in your computer.</p>
         <p>And you keep the code: all the code. Your data is safe and the code fully auditable.</p>
		
            </div>
			
			
		<div id="Who" style="display:none">
              <h4><strong>For who is Client Side Solutions meant ?</i></strong></h4>
              <br>
              <ul>
			  <li>People who want to explore analytic and digital solutions without entering complex and cumbersome solutions</li>
			  <li>People with limited IT ressources : either because of strict IT constraints or lack of IT ressources</li>
			  <li>Hobbyists who wants to play with data and simple analytic solutions without having to spend time installing lots of dependancies / creating an account for a cloud service they won't use 2 month later.</li>
			  </ul>
			<p>Try the showcased applications. Your needs might be solved by solutions much simplier than what you thought.</p>

			<div id="About me" style="display:none">
              <h4><strong>About me</i></strong></h4>
              <br>
              <p>Experienced data scientist, I have worked in insurance and asset management. </p>
			  <p>I am currently lucky to have at my disposal all the IT ressources I need to quickly put in production analytical projects I am working on</p>
				<p>But it has not always been the case. Hence this side project: to find the light even through the darkest of times.</p>
			  <p>Forbidden to use any programming languages besides MS office = Excel is the only solution ? Nope !</p>
