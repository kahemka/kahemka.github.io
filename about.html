                           <h4>Why CSS</h4>
                           <p>Client Side Solutions : Working on the client side.</p>
        <p>Server based/online/cloud solutions are convenient to sell : You take your customer's data and you keep the code.</p>
		 <p>Howevever, there are several issues for the customer: the end product does not entirely belong him. If interested, he is forced to subscribe and pay recurrent fees. 
		 And if he unsubscribes, back to square one with another solution.</p>
        <p>Another issue: these solutions are not meant for everyone.</p>

		<p>Indeed, server based solutions might not be allowed in some IT environment : issue regarding sending sensitive data, not enough IT maturity or lack of programming skills.
		</p>
          <p>Last but not least: While the server based approach enables complex analytic operations, it is often overkill regarding the targeted task. Wasting energy and unecessary ressources:</p>

                     <!-- Single Experience -->
                     <li>
                        <div class="timeline_content">
                        <span>How <i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
                           <h4>How does CSS work ?</h4>
                           <p>Client Side Solutions : Working on <b>client side</b>.</p>
        <p>Put it simply : when you are visiting a website, your computer is doing some work to render what you are seeing.
        Client Side Solutions just ask him on top of that, a little extra-work to perform specific tasks instead of requesting cloud ressources.</p>
        <p>For tasks showcased here : no need to spend more energy powering up distant servers to achieve what is needed.
          No need to send (sensitive) data far away: everything stay in your computer.</p>
         <p>And you keep the code. Your data is safe and the code fully auditable.</p>

                           <h4>For who is CSS designed ?</h4>
						   <p>People looking for simple & tailored solutions as the one that are showcased here.</p>
						   <p>People with limited IT ressources : either because of strict IT constraints or lack of IT ressources.</p>
						   <p>Hobbyists who wants to play with data and simple analytic solutions without having to spend time installing lots of dependancies / creating an account for a cloud service they won't use 2 month later.</p>
